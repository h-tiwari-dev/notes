#  Octomind User Workflow and Implementation

## 1. Initial Setup

User Action:
- The user navigates to the platform's website and is presented with a simple interface to enter their web application's URL.

Implementation:
- The platform provides a  landing page with a prominent input field for the URL.
- When the user submits the URL, the system initiates a background process to analyze the web application.
	- It most probably uses a vision model to interact with the ui and get the login details. It also does not handle oauth implementaions. It uses that happy interaction to create a playwright script and run it.

## 2. Web Application Analysis

Implementation:
- The system crawls the provided URL, mapping out the structure of the web application.
- AI models analyze the application's UI, identifying key elements, forms, and interactive components.
- This analysis forms the basis for test case generation.

## 3. Initial Test Case Generation

Implementation:
- Based on the analysis, the AI generates a set of initial test cases covering basic functionality like login, navigation, and core features.
- These test cases are created using natural language processing models trained on common web application patterns and best testing practices.

## 4. User Review and Customization

User Action:
- The user is presented with the initial set of generated test cases.


Implementation:
- The platform provides text box to create test cases.
- Users can customize tests using simple, natural language instructions which the AI interprets and translates into executable test steps.

## 5. Test Execution

User Action:
- The user initiates the test run, either for all cases or selected ones.

Implementation:
- The system uses browser automation (likely Playwright) to execute the tests.
- Each test step is performed on a virtual browser, simulating real user interactions(on the server) using visison model or some model to recognize things to interact with.
- The AI model assists in element detection and interaction, making the tests more robust against UI changes.


## 6. Results and Reporting

Implementation:
- It provides a playwright trace view implementation. 
- The system generates a comprehensive report, highlighting passed and failed tests.
- AI-driven analysis provides insights into patterns in failures and suggests potential improvements.
- Visual elements like screenshots and video recordings of failed tests are included for easier debugging.

## Conclusion
Needed to create a poc, but this can be possible to test viability in 2-4 days or half a week.

#  Test Rigor User Workflow and Implementation

Uses most probably vision model and screen shots. Same as octomind but gets in an infinite loop trying to login where as octomind succeeded.

# Stably.ai: AI-powered End-to-end Testing

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Real-time Rendering**
   - The simulator displays a live, interactive version of the website being tested.
   - It updates in real-time as test steps are executed or recorded.

2. **Accurate Visual Representation**
   - The simulator accurately renders the website, including layout, styles, and interactive elements.
   - It mimics different browser environments to ensure cross-browser compatibility testing.

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Users can interact with the simulated browser just as they would with a real browser.
   - Clicks, form inputs, and other user actions are captured and can be incorporated into the test steps.

4. **Browser Controls**
   - The simulator includes browser-like controls such as navigation buttons, address bar, and potentially even developer tools.

#### Benefits of the User Browser Simulator:

- Provides a visual representation of test execution, making it easier for non-technical users to understand and create tests.
- Allows for immediate feedback on test steps, reducing the time needed for test creation and debugging.
- Enables more accurate testing by simulating real browser environments and user interactions.
- Facilitates collaboration between developers, QA engineers, and other stakeholders by providing a common visual reference.

## Implementation (Pseudo code)

### Backend Setup

Create a `server.js` file with the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const http = require('http');
   const socketIo = require('socket.io');
   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

   const app = express();
   const server = http.createServer(app);
   const io = socketIo(server, {
     cors: {
       origin: "http://localhost:3000",
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]
     }
   });

   let browser;
   let page;

   async function initializePuppeteer() {
     browser = await puppeteer.launch();
     page = await browser.newPage();
     await page.setViewport({ width: 1280, height: 800 });
   }

   io.on('connection', (socket) => {
     console.log('New client connected');

     socket.on('loadUrl', async (url) => {
       try {
         await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });
         const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ encoding: 'base64' });
         socket.emit('pageLoaded', { screenshot });
         
         const boxes = await getElementBoxes();
         socket.emit('elementBoxesUpdated', boxes);

         await setupEventListeners(socket);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error loading page:', error);
         socket.emit('error', { message: 'Failed to load page' });
       }
     });

     socket.on('disconnect', () => {
       console.log('Client disconnected');
     });
   });

   async function getElementBoxes() {
     // Implementation details...
   }

   async function setupEventListeners(socket) {
     // Implementation details...
   }

   const PORT = 3001;
   server.listen(PORT, async () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
     await initializePuppeteer();
   });
   ```

### Frontend Setup

Replace the content of `src/App.js` with the following code:

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
   import io from 'socket.io-client';

   const BrowserReplica = () => {
     const [url, setUrl] = useState('https://example.com');
     const [screenshot, setScreenshot] = useState(null);
     const [highlights, setHighlights] = useState([]);
     const [hoveredElement, setHoveredElement] = useState(null);
     const canvasRef = useRef(null);
     const overlayRef = useRef(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');

       socket.on('pageLoaded', ({ screenshot }) => {
         setScreenshot(`data:image/png;base64,${screenshot}`);
       });

       socket.on('elementBoxesUpdated', (boxes) => {
         setHighlights(boxes);
       });

       socket.on('click', (data) => {
         console.log('Click event:', data);
       });

       socket.on('mousemove', (data) => {
         const hoveredBox = highlights.find(box => 
           data.x >= box.x && data.x <= box.x + box.width &&
           data.y >= box.y && data.y <= box.y + box.height
         );
         setHoveredElement(hoveredBox);
       });

       return () => socket.disconnect();
     }, [highlights]);

     // Rest of the component implementation...

     return (
       <div className="browser-replica">
         {/* Component JSX */}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default BrowserReplica;
   ```

## Considerations

This is the one we can create a poc in a week and try it out create and run test cases for the user parallel to our own implementations. The extension will be use less and we might need another backend service. 
**This is the one where I have more confidence in implementation**


# Meticulous AI: Code Implementation Strategy

   - Implements a JavaScript snippet for capturing user interactions
   - Snippet is easily integrated into various frontend frameworks

4. **Code Snippet Integration**
   ```javascript
   {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
     <script 
       data-project-id="..."
       src="https://snippet.meticulous.ai/v1/meticulous.js"
     ></script>
   )}

   - Environment-specific activation (e.g., development only)

5. **Network Request Mocking**
   - Automatic interception and mocking of backend requests
   - Implemented at the browser level for comprehensive coverage

6. **Visual Snapshot Capture**
   - Likely uses browser APIs or WebDriver for full-page screenshots
   - Captures snapshots after each simulated user interaction

7. **AI-Driven Test Selection and Generation**
   - Algorithms to analyze captured user sessions
   - Automatic generation of test cases based on interaction data

8. **Code Coverage Tracking**
   - Implements code instrumentation to track executed branches
   - Likely uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis for comprehensive coverage

9. **Visual Diffing (Assumed)**
    - Likely uses image comparison algorithms
    - May implement DOM structure analysis for context-aware diffing
### Conclusion 
Need further reading to understand how the tests are runned or generated. How does it diff and run different thing in the PR? This is still to be determined.
