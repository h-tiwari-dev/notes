## Introduction
Paxos is a fundamental consensus protocol designed to achieve consistency in distributed systems. It was first introduced by Leslie Lamport in 1989 and is widely used in distributed databases and state machine replication.

## Basic Concepts

### Key Properties
- Safety: Only a single value is chosen
- Liveness: Eventually some value is chosen
- Fault Tolerance: Continues despite failures

    A[Distributed System] --> B[Consistency]
    B --> C[Safety]
    B --> D[Liveness]
    B --> E[Fault Tolerance]
    C --> F[Single Value Choice]
    D --> G[Progress Guarantee]
    E --> H[Failure Handling]
```

## Paxos Roles

### Core Participants
1. Proposers: Propose values
2. Acceptors: Accept/reject proposals
3. Learners: Learn chosen values

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Proposer] -->|Proposes| B[Acceptor]
    B -->|Accepts/Rejects| A
    B -->|Notifies| C[Learner]
    C -->|Learns Value| D[Final State]
```

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Prepare
The prepare phase ensures a proposer can safely propose a value.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Proposer
    participant A as Acceptor
    P->>A: Prepare(n)
    A->>P: Promise(n, accepted_value)
```

### Phase 2: Accept
The accept phase attempts to get a value accepted by a majority.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Proposer
    participant A as Acceptor
    P->>A: Accept(n, value)
    A->>P: Accepted(n)
```

## Failure Scenarios

### Common Failures
1. Network Partitions
2. Message Loss
3. Process Crashes

```mermaid

    A --> C[Message Loss]
    A --> D[Process Crashes]

    D --> G[Leader Election]
```
