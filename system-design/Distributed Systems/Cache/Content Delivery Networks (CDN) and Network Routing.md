1. Origin Server
   - Houses the original content
   - Serves as the source of truth for all CDN edge servers
   - Typically located in one or more central data centers

2. Edge Servers
   - Distributed globally across multiple locations
   - Cache and serve content closer to end users
   - Reduce latency and bandwidth costs
   - Provide redundancy and fault tolerance

3. Load Balancers
   - Distribute requests across multiple servers
   - Perform health checks on servers
   - Implement failover mechanisms

### Content Distribution Methods

#### Push CDN
- Content is proactively pushed to edge servers
- Suitable for static content that doesn't change frequently
- Provides consistent performance but requires more storage
- Example use cases: static websites, software downloads

#### Pull CDN
- Content is pulled from origin when first requested
- Cached at edge locations based on demand
- More efficient for dynamic content
- Example use cases: news websites, social media

## Network Routing and BGP
# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Deep Dive

## Core BGP Concepts

### Autonomous System (AS) Explained
An Autonomous System (AS) is a network or collection of networks under a single administrative domain. Think of it as a "country" in the Internet world, with:

- Unique identification through AS Numbers (ASN)
- Internal routing policies
- External routing relationships
- Range of IP addresses (prefixes) it controls

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "AS 65001 - ISP"
        R1[Border Router]
        I1[Internal Router]
        I2[Internal Router]
    end
    
    subgraph "AS 65002 - Enterprise"
        R2[Border Router]
        E1[Internal Router]
        E2[Internal Router]
    end
    
    R1 <-->|eBGP| R2
    R1 <-->|iBGP| I1
    R1 <-->|iBGP| I2
    I1 <-->|IGP| I2
    
    R2 <-->|iBGP| E1
    R2 <-->|iBGP| E2
    E1 <-->|IGP| E2
```

### Types of BGP Sessions

1. **eBGP (External BGP)**
   - Sessions between different ASes
   - Typically directly connected
   - Changes AS path when advertising routes
   - Primary focus on security and policy enforcement

2. **iBGP (Internal BGP)**
   - Sessions within the same AS
   - Can traverse multiple hops
   - Does not modify AS path
   - Requires full mesh or route reflectors

## BGP Path Selection Process in Detail

### Path Selection Criteria Explained

1. **Weight (Cisco Specific)**
   - Local to the router
   - Higher weight preferred
   - Range: 0-65535
   - Example:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 weight 100
     ```

2. **Local Preference**
   - AS-wide metric
   - Higher value preferred
   - Default: 100
   - Example:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map SET_LOCAL_PREF in
     route-map SET_LOCAL_PREF permit 10
     set local-preference 200
     ```

3. **AS Path Length**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       AS1 -->|Path: 1| AS2
       AS1 -->|Path: 1 2 3| AS2
       
       style AS1 fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
       style AS2 fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
   ```
   - Shorter path preferred
   - Can be manipulated with AS path prepending
   - Example:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map PREPEND out
     route-map PREPEND permit 10
     set as-path prepend 65001 65001
     ```

4. **Origin Type**
   - IGP (i) most preferred
   - EGP (e) second choice
   - Incomplete (?) least preferred

5. **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)**
   - Lower value preferred
   - Used for influencing inbound traffic
   - Example:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map SET_MED out
     route-map SET_MED permit 10
     set metric 100
     ```

## BGP in CDN Environments

### CDN BGP Routing Strategies

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Global CDN AS"
        subgraph "Region 1"
            R1[Router 1]
            E1[Edge 1]
            E2[Edge 2]
        end
        
        subgraph "Region 2"
            R2[Router 2]
            E3[Edge 3]
            E4[Edge 4]
        end
    end
    
    ISP1[ISP 1] <-->|eBGP| R1
    ISP2[ISP 2] <-->|eBGP| R2
    R1 <-->|iBGP| R2
    
    R1 --> E1
    R1 --> E2
    R2 --> E3
    R2 --> E4
```

6. **Anycast Routing**
   - Multiple edge locations advertise same IP prefix
   - Traffic automatically routed to nearest edge
   - Example configuration:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     network 192.0.2.0/24
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65002
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map ANYCAST out
     ```

7. **Route Health Injection (RHI)**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant E as Edge Server
       participant R as BGP Router
       participant ISP as Internet
       
       E->>R: Health Check OK
       R->>ISP: Advertise Route
       Note over E,ISP: Normal Operation
       E->>R: Health Check Fail
       R->>ISP: Withdraw Route
       Note over E,ISP: Failover
   ```
   - Dynamic route advertisement based on health
   - Automated failover mechanism
   - Example configuration:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65002
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map CHECK_HEALTH out
     ```

### BGP Community Usage in CDNs

Communities are used to:
8. Control route distribution
9. Influence path selection
10. Apply specific policies

Example community configurations:
```
ip community-list 1 permit 65001:100  ! Local routes
ip community-list 2 permit 65001:200  ! Customer routes
ip community-list 3 permit 65001:300  ! Peer routes

route-map SET_COMMUNITY permit 10
 set community 65001:100
```

### BGP Security Considerations

11. **RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)**
   - Validates route origins
   - Prevents route hijacking
   - Example configuration:
     ```
     router bgp 65001
     bgp rpki server tcp 192.168.1.10 port 3323
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 ebgp-multihop 2
     neighbor 192.168.1.1 prefix-validation
     ```

12. **BGP Authentication**
   ```
   router bgp 65001
   neighbor 192.168.1.1 password secure_password
   ```

13. **Route Filtering**
   ```
   ip prefix-list ALLOWED_PREFIXES seq 10 permit 192.168.0.0/16
   neighbor 192.168.1.1 prefix-list ALLOWED_PREFIXES in
   ```

## Troubleshooting BGP

### Common BGP Issues and Solutions

14. **Neighbor Establishment Issues**
   - Check TCP connectivity
   - Verify AS numbers
   - Confirm authentication
   - Commands:
     ```
     show ip bgp summary
     show ip bgp neighbors
     debug ip bgp
     ```

15. **Route Advertisement Issues**
   - Check route policies
   - Verify network statements
   - Examine route maps
   - Commands:
     ```
     show ip bgp
     show ip bgp neighbors advertised-routes
     show ip bgp neighbors received-routes
     ```

### How CDNs Use BGP

#### Anycast Routing
- Multiple edge servers advertise the same IP address
- Requests are automatically routed to the nearest server
- Provides automatic failover and load distribution

#### BGP Route Optimization
18. Path Manipulation
   - CDNs influence routing decisions through BGP attributes
   - AS path prepending to prefer certain routes
   - Community strings for traffic engineering

19. Route Health Injection (RHI)
   - Dynamically advertise or withdraw routes based on server health
   - Enables automatic failover
   - Ensures traffic only flows to healthy servers

## DNS in CDNs

### DNS-Based Load Balancing
20. Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)
   - Uses DNS to direct users to optimal edge locations
   - Considers factors like:
     - Geographic proximity
     - Server load
     - Network conditions
     - Server health

21. Dynamic DNS Updates
   - Real-time updates based on:
     - Network topology changes
     - Server availability
     - Traffic patterns

### DNS Resolution Process
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant LDNS as Local DNS
    participant RDNS as Root DNS
    participant CDNS as CDN DNS
    participant E as Edge Server
    participant O as Origin
    
    U->>LDNS: Request content.example.com
    LDNS->>RDNS: Query root DNS
    RDNS->>LDNS: Refer to CDN DNS
    LDNS->>CDNS: Query CDN DNS
    CDNS->>LDNS: Return nearest edge IP
    LDNS->>U: Provide edge server IP
    U->>E: Request content
    alt Cache Hit
        E->>U: Serve cached content
    else Cache Miss
        E->>O: Fetch content
        O->>E: Return content
        E->>U: Serve content
    end
```

22. User requests content
23. DNS query to CDN's authoritative nameserver
24. CDN determines optimal edge location
25. Returns IP address of selected edge server
26. User connects directly to edge server

### Cache Hierarchy
```mermaid
graph TB
    U[User] --> E[Edge Cache]
    E --> R[Regional Cache]
    R --> S[Shield Cache]
    S --> O[Origin Server]
    
    style U fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style R fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style S fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
