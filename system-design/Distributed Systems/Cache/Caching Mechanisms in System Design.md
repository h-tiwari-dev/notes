## Introduction

Caching is a critical component in system design, used to improve performance, reduce latency, and decrease the load on backend systems. This document explores various caching strategies and their applications, with a focus on how they might be implemented in systems like Obsidian.

## Types of Caches

### 1. In-Memory Cache

In-memory caching stores frequently accessed data in the computer's RAM for quick retrieval.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{In Memory Cache?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Retrieve from Memory]
    B -->|No| D[Fetch from Disk/DB]
    D --> E[Store in Memory Cache]
    C --> F[Return Data]
    E --> F
```

#### Applications in Obsidian:
- Caching recently accessed notes
- Storing search index for quick lookups
- Keeping plugin data in memory for faster access

### 2. Distributed Cache

A distributed cache spreads data across multiple nodes, allowing for horizontal scaling and improved fault tolerance.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B{Cache Node 1}
    A --> C{Cache Node 2}
    A --> D{Cache Node 3}
    B --> E[Data Store]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

#### Potential Use in Obsidian:
- Caching shared resources in a multi-user Obsidian setup
- Distributing the search index across nodes for large vaults

### 3. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

CDNs cache content at geographically distributed edge locations to reduce latency for users worldwide.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Origin Server] --> B[CDN Edge Location 1]
    A --> C[CDN Edge Location 2]
    A --> D[CDN Edge Location 3]
    B --> E[User 1]
    C --> F[User 2]
    D --> G[User 3]
```

#### Relevance to Obsidian:
- Caching static assets like images or attachments in Obsidian Publish
- Distributing plugin resources for faster access

### 4. Database Cache

Database caching involves storing query results or frequently accessed database records in memory.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application] --> B{Cache}
    B -->|Cache Hit| C[Return Cached Data]
    B -->|Cache Miss| D[Query Database]
    D --> E[Update Cache]
    E --> C
```

#### Obsidian Application:
- Caching metadata about notes, links, and tags
- Storing frequently accessed plugin data

## Caching Strategies

### 1. Write-Through Cache

In this strategy, data is written to both the cache and the underlying storage simultaneously.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Application
    participant C as Cache
    participant D as Database
    A->>C: Write Data
    C->>D: Write Data
    D-->>C: Confirm Write
    C-->>A: Write Complete
```

**Pros:**
- Data consistency between cache and storage
- Reduced risk of data loss

**Cons:**
- Higher latency for write operations

### 2. Write-Back (Write-Behind) Cache

Data is written to the cache and only later propagated to the underlying storage.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Application
    participant C as Cache
    participant D as Database
    A->>C: Write Data
    C-->>A: Write Complete
    C->>D: Async Write
    D-->>C: Confirm Write
```

**Pros:**
- Lower write latency
- Reduced load on the underlying storage

**Cons:**
- Risk of data loss if cache fails before writing to storage

### 3. Read-Through Cache

On a cache miss, the cache itself is responsible for loading the data from the underlying storage.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Application
    participant C as Cache
    participant D as Database
    A->>C: Read Data
    alt Cache Hit
        C-->>A: Return Data
    else Cache Miss
        C->>D: Fetch Data
        D-->>C: Return Data
        C-->>A: Return Data
    end
```

**Pros:**
- Simplified application logic
- Consistent data loading mechanism

**Cons:**
- Initial read for uncached data might be slower

### 4. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)

The application is responsible for reading and writing from both the cache and the underlying storage.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Application
    participant C as Cache
    participant D as Database
    A->>C: Read Data
    alt Cache Hit
        C-->>A: Return Data
    else Cache Miss
        A->>D: Fetch Data
        D-->>A: Return Data
        A->>C: Update Cache
    end
```

**Pros:**
- Works well for read-heavy workloads
- Application has more control over the caching logic

**Cons:**
- Initial cache misses can be slow
- Potential for stale data if not managed properly

## Cache Eviction Policies

1. **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Removes the least recently accessed items first.
2. **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: Evicts the items that are accessed the least often.
3. **First In First Out (FIFO)**: Removes the oldest entries first.
4. **Time To Live (TTL)**: Automatically expires cache entries after a set duration.

## Advanced Caching Concepts

### 1. Intelligent Load Balancing

Use machine learning to predict task complexity and distribute cache load accordingly.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming Tasks] --> B[ML Predictor]
    B --> C{Load Balancer}
    C --> D[Cache Node 1]
    C --> E[Cache Node 2]
    C --> F[Cache Node 3]
```

### 2. Multi-Tiered Caching

Implement multiple levels of caching for different types of data or access patterns.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B[L1 Cache: In-Memory]
    B --> C[L2 Cache: Distributed]
    C --> D[L3 Cache: CDN]
    D --> E[Origin Data Store]
```

### 3. Cache Warming

Proactively populate the cache with likely-to-be-used data to improve initial performance.

### 4. Cache Consistency Protocols

Implement protocols to ensure consistency across distributed cache nodes:
- MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) protocol
- Write-invalidate protocol
- Directory-based protocols


## Hashing in Caching Systems

Hashing plays a crucial role in distributed caching systems, enabling efficient data distribution and retrieval across multiple cache nodes.

### Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a technique used to distribute data across multiple cache nodes while minimizing reorganization when nodes are added or removed.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Key] --> B[Hash Function]
    B --> C[Hash Ring]
    C --> D[Cache Node 1]
    C --> E[Cache Node 2]
    C --> F[Cache Node 3]
```

#### Benefits:
- Minimizes keys that need to be remapped when scaling
- Allows for dynamic addition or removal of cache nodes

#### Implementation:
1. Map cache nodes to points on a hash ring
2. Hash the key to a point on the ring
3. Move clockwise to find the first cache node

### Hash Functions in Caching

Common hash functions used in caching systems include:

4. **MD5**: Produces a 128-bit hash value
5. **SHA-1**: Generates a 160-bit hash value
6. **MurmurHash**: Designed for fast hashing of keys
7. **CRC32**: Simple and fast, but with higher collision risk

### Collision Resolution

In case of hash collisions, strategies include:

8. **Chaining**: Store colliding items in a linked list
9. **Open Addressing**: Find the next available slot in the hash table
10. **Double Hashing**: Use a second hash function to resolve collisions

## Sharding in Distributed Caching

Sharding is a database partitioning technique that can be applied to distributed caching systems to improve scalability and performance.

### Sharding Strategies

11. **Range-Based Sharding**: Divide data based on ranges of a key
12. **Hash-Based Sharding**: Use a hash of the key to determine the shard
13. **Directory-Based Sharding**: Maintain a lookup table for shard locations

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming Data] --> B{Shard Router}
    B -->|Hash 1| C[Shard 1]
    B -->|Hash 2| D[Shard 2]
    B -->|Hash 3| E[Shard 3]
```

### Benefits of Sharding in Caching

14. **Improved Scalability**: Easily add more shards to handle increased load
15. **Better Performance**: Parallel processing across multiple shards
16. **Increased Availability**: Failure in one shard doesn't affect others

### Challenges and Considerations

17. **Data Rebalancing**: Needed when adding or removing shards
18. **Cross-Shard Operations**: Can be complex and impact performance
19. **Hot Spots**: Uneven data distribution can lead to performance issues

### Implementing Sharding in a Distributed Cache

20. **Determine Shard Key**: Choose a key that evenly distributes data
21. **Select Sharding Strategy**: Based on data characteristics and access patterns
22. **Implement Shard Router**: Direct requests to appropriate shards
23. **Handle Shard Management**: For adding, removing, or rebalancing shards

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant R as Shard Router
    participant S1 as Shard 1
    participant S2 as Shard 2
    C->>R: Request Data
    R->>R: Determine Shard
    alt Data in Shard 1
        R->>S1: Fetch Data
        S1-->>R: Return Data
    else Data in Shard 2
        R->>S2: Fetch Data
        S2-->>R: Return Data
    end
    R-->>C: Return Data
```

### Sharding in Specific Use Cases

24. **Large-Scale Web Applications**: 
   - Shard cache based on user ID or geographic location
   - Improve response times for geographically distributed users

25. **IoT Data Processing**:
   - Shard based on device ID or data type
   - Enable efficient processing of high-volume sensor data

26. **E-commerce Platforms**:
