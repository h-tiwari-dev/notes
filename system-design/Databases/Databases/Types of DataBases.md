## Overview
Databases are structured collections of data that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.

## Database Types Relationship
```mermaid

    A[Database Types] --> B[Relational RDBMS]
    A --> C[NoSQL Databases]
    A --> D[Time Series]
    A --> E[In-Memory Databases]

    C --> F[Document Databases]
    C --> G[Key-Value Stores]
    C --> H[Column-Family Databases]
    C --> I[Graph Databases]
```

## Relational Database Structure
```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        int id PK
        date order_date
        float total_amount
    }
```

## NoSQL Database Types

```

## Detailed Database Characteristics

### 1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
- Uses structured tables with rows and columns
- Follows SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
- Best for: Structured data with clear relationships

### 2. NoSQL Databases
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scalability
- Different data models

### 3. Time Series Databases
- Optimized for time-stamped data
- Examples: InfluxDB, Prometheus

### 4. In-Memory Databases
- Data stored directly in RAM
- Extremely fast read/write operations
