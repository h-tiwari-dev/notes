# Choosing Databases in System Design Interviews

## üéØ Key Points

- **SQL Databases**: Best for structured data, ACID compliance, complex relationships
  - Use when: Financial systems, e-commerce, complex reporting needs
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
  - Strengths: Data integrity, JOIN operations, transaction support

- **NoSQL Databases**: Best for unstructured data, scalability, flexible schemas
  - Use when: Big data, real-time applications, rapid schema changes
  - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
  - Strengths: Horizontal scaling, high throughput, schema flexibility

- **Decision Factors**:
  - Data structure (structured vs unstructured)
  - Scaling requirements (vertical vs horizontal)
  - Consistency needs (ACID vs BASE)
  - Query complexity (JOINs vs denormalized data)
  - Development speed vs data integrity

## üíº Database Migration Case Study

### Project Overview

- **Company**: FinTech Payment Processing Platform
- **Timeline**: Q2-Q4 2023 (6 months)
- **Challenge**: Migration from MongoDB to MySQL
- **Team Size**: 8 engineers (3 backend, 2 DBAs, 3 QA)
- **Scale**: Processing 2M+ daily transactions

### Why We Migrated

- Need for ACID compliance and data consistency
- Complex reporting requiring JOIN operations
- Improved transaction management for financial data
- Structured schema enforcement for regulatory compliance
- Better data integrity with foreign key constraints
- Requirement for complex multi-table transactions
- Enhanced support for financial reporting tools
- Standardized data model across the organization

### Migration Strategy

#### 1. **Assessment Phase** (3 weeks)

- **Database Size**: 2TB of MongoDB collections
- **Critical Collections**: Payments, Users, Merchants, Settlements
- **Peak Load**: 3000 TPS during business hours
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Analyzed MongoDB document structures
  - Designed normalized MySQL schema
  - Mapped complex MongoDB queries to SQL
  - Identified embedded document relationships

#### 3. **Execution Phase** (12 weeks)

- **Dual-Write Implementation**: Ensured safe parallel data writes
- **Incremental Migration**: Collection-wise migration approach
  - Historical data migration
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Relationship data transformation
- **Thorough Testing**:
  - Data integrity validation
  - Transaction consistency checks
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Query optimization
- **Gradual Traffic Migration**: Used feature flags for staged deployment
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Alerts for performance anomalies

### Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Data Structure Transformation**
    - Converting nested MongoDB documents to normalized MySQL tables
    - Handling arrays and embedded documents
    - Establishing proper relationships and foreign keys
    - Managing ObjectID to Primary Key conversion

### Migration Results

- Achieved **ACID compliance** for all transactions
- **50% improvement** in complex reporting queries
- Enhanced **data consistency and integrity**
- Reduced **data redundancy by 45%**
- Improved **transaction reliability**
- Simplified **regulatory compliance reporting**
- Achieved **99.99% uptime** during migration
- Reduced **operational complexity**

## üåê Real-World Database Examples

### SQL Databases

- **MySQL**: OLTP workloads, e-commerce, strong replication
- **PostgreSQL**: Complex queries, advanced data types, extensibility
- **Oracle**: Enterprise applications, high availability, security features

### NoSQL Databases

- **MongoDB**: Document-based, flexible schema, horizontal scaling
- **Cassandra**: Large-scale distributed systems, multi-datacenter replication
- **Redis**: In-memory store, caching, real-time analytics
- **Neo4j**: Graph-based relationships, ACID compliance

## üî¨ Performance Metrics to Consider

### SQL Metrics

- Query complexity, execution time
- JOIN operation efficiency
- Indexing strategies
- Transaction volume & throughput
- Connection pool efficiency

### NoSQL Metrics

- Read/write latency
- Sharding effectiveness
- Replication factor impact
- Query scatter-gather efficiency

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### SQL Pitfalls

- Over-normalization
- Inefficient indexing
- Poor query optimization

### NoSQL Pitfalls

- Lack of ACID guarantees
- Complex consistency management
- Potential data redundancy

## üí° Interview Strategies

2. **Understand requirements**
3. **Analyze data characteristics**
4. **Compare database capabilities**
5. **Propose a solution with trade-offs**

## üîó Hybrid Approaches

- **Polyglot persistence**: Combining SQL & NoSQL solutions
- **Microservices**: Using different databases for different services
- **Caching layers**: Improving performance with Redis
