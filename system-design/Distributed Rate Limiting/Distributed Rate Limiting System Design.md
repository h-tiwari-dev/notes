## Timer Wheel Deep Dive
#algorithms #timer-wheel #implementation

### Timer Wheel Structure
A Timer Wheel is an efficient data structure for managing large numbers of timed events with different timeout values.

#### Components

   - Multiple buckets (slots)
   - Each bucket represents a time interval
   - Circular array implementation

2. **Bucket Management**
   - Request timestamp tracking
   - Efficient memory usage
   - O(1) operations

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Timer Wheel
        A[Current Pointer] --> B[Bucket 0]
        B --> C[Bucket 1]
        C --> D[Bucket 2]
        D --> E[...]
        E --> F[Bucket N-1]
        F --> B
    end
    
    subgraph Bucket Details
        G[Bucket] --> H[Request List]
        H --> I[Timestamp]
        H --> J[Request Data]
        H --> K[Counter]
    end
```

### Implementation Details
#implementation #optimization

#### Time Complexity
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)
- Search: O(1)

## Integration with Oracle
#integration #system-design

The Timer Wheel is a crucial component that works in conjunction with the Oracle for efficient rate limiting:

1. **Oracle Management**
   - Configures wheel parameters
   - Monitors wheel performance
   - Adjusts limits dynamically

2. **Distributed Coordination**
   - Synchronizes wheel state
   - Handles partitioning
   - Manages failover

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Oracle] --> B[Timer Wheel Manager]
    B --> C[Wheel 1]
    B --> D[Wheel 2]
    B --> E[Wheel N]
    
    F[Monitoring] --> A
    G[Configuration] --> A
    H[Alerts] --> A
```

*Note: The Timer Wheel implementation provides an efficient solution for rate limiting in distributed systems, while the Oracle ensures proper coordination and management of the entire system.*
