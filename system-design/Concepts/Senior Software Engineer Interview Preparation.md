## 1. System Design

### Key Topics

- **Scalability & Performance**
  - Load balancing (e.g., HAProxy, Nginx, AWS ALB)
    - Distributes traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading.
    - Implements algorithms like round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
  - Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached, CDN)
    - Reduces database load and speeds up responses.
    - Use cases include session storage, query caching, and API response caching.
  - Database sharding & replication (PostgreSQL, MySQL, NoSQL)
    - Improves availability and fault tolerance by distributing data.
    - Vertical vs. horizontal scaling trade-offs.
  - Asynchronous processing (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
    - Enables event-driven architectures and reduces request-response blocking.
  - Rate limiting & throttling
    - Prevents API abuse and maintains fair usage policies.
- **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**
  - Circuit breakers (e.g., Resilience4j, Hystrix)
    - Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems.
    - Detects failures and short-circuits to avoid retry storms.
  - Distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos, Zookeeper, Etcd)
    - Ensures consistency in distributed databases and leader elections.
  - Leader election & failover strategies
    - Promotes a standby node when the primary node fails.
- **Consistency & Data Integrity**

  - CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
    - Trade-offs in distributed system design.
  - Eventual vs. strong consistency
    - Use eventual consistency for performance gains in global systems.
  - Transactions & ACID properties
    - Ensures safe database operations.
  - Idempotency & deduplication
    - Prevents duplicate processing of messages in event-driven systems.

### Case Studies

- **Enterprise Payment Processing Platform**

  - Redis for caching & deduplication
  - Circuit breakers for failover handling
  - UPI/IMPS/NEFT workflows with rollback strategies
  - SLA-driven optimizations to achieve 99.99% uptime
- **Intelligent Task Processing System**

  - LangChain for AI-powered task generation
  - Redis-backed distributed queues
  - Vector search for relevance ranking
  - Fault tolerance & dynamic load balancing

## 2. Data Structures & Algorithms

### Key Concepts

- **Sorting & Searching**: QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, Hashing
- **Graphs & Trees**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A* Search, Trie, Segment Trees
- **Concurrency & Parallelism**: Locking, Deadlocks, Thread Safety
- **Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms**

### Practice Questions

- Design a **rate limiter** using Redis.
  - Use a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm.
  - Implement sliding window counters for dynamic rate control.
- Implement **LRU Cache** using Doubly Linked List & HashMap.
  - Achieves O(1) insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- Find the **shortest path** in a weighted graph.
  - Implement Dijkstraâ€™s or A* for efficient search.
- Implement **circuit breaker** pattern.
  - Detect failures, introduce backoff strategies, and use retry mechanisms.

## 3. Backend Engineering Deep Dive

### Key Focus Areas

- **Microservices & API Design**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC
  - REST is stateless and follows CRUD principles.
  - GraphQL provides flexible queries with a single endpoint.
  - gRPC uses Protobuf for performance-efficient communication.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, Query Optimization, Partitioning
  - Use composite indexes for multi-column queries.
  - Optimize slow queries using EXPLAIN plans.
- **Distributed Systems**: CAP Theorem, Consistency Models, Event Sourcing
  - Use CQRS for read-heavy architectures.
- **Observability**: Logging, Monitoring, Tracing (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
  - Implement distributed tracing for debugging microservices.

### Hands-on Coding Exercises

- Implement a **distributed task queue** using Redis & Celery.
  - Use job priority queues and delayed task execution.
- Design a **fault-tolerant job scheduler**.
  - Implement retry policies and job deduplication.
- Build a **payment gateway integration** with rollback & reconciliation.
  - Handle payment failures gracefully with compensating transactions.

## 4. Behavioral & Leadership Questions

### Common Topics

- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling disagreements in architecture decisions
  - Use data-driven approaches to resolve conflicts.
- **Scalability Trade-offs**: When to optimize vs. when to ship
  - Balance engineering efforts with business impact.
- **Mentorship & Collaboration**: Working with cross-functional teams
  - Encourage knowledge sharing through code reviews and documentation.
- **Incident Handling**: Learning from outages & post-mortems
  - Conduct blameless retrospectives to improve reliability.

### Example Scenarios

- "Tell me about a time when you had to scale a system quickly."
  - Provide a real-world example of implementing caching or database sharding.
- "How do you handle production incidents under pressure?"
  - Follow the incident response lifecycle: Detect, Respond, Mitigate, Recover.
- "Describe a technical decision where you had to balance speed vs. correctness."
  - Explain trade-offs made between time-to-market and technical debt.
