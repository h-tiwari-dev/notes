# Apache Kafka: Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Fundamental Concepts
#fundamentals

### What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that:
- Publishes and subscribes to streams of records
- Stores streams of records durably and reliably
- Processes streams of records in real-time

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Sources] -->|Produce| B[Kafka Cluster]
    B -->|Store| C[Topics & Partitions]
    C -->|Consume| D[Applications]
    E[ZooKeeper] -->|Manage| B
    
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Core Architecture Components
#architecture

#### 1. Topics
**Definition**: Named categories or feed names to which records are published

**Characteristics**:
- Identified by unique names within cluster
- Can have multiple subscribers (consumers)
- Maintain events for configurable retention period
- Immutable sequence of records

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Producer] -->|Write| B[Topic]
    B -->|Partition 1| C[Messages]
    B -->|Partition 2| D[Messages]
    B -->|Partition N| E[Messages]
    
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Configuration Options**:
- retention.ms: How long to keep messages
- retention.bytes: Maximum size of topic
- cleanup.policy: Delete or compact
- min.insync.replicas: Minimum replicas for writes

#### 2. Partitions
**Definition**: Physical organization of topics, divided into ordered, immutable sequence of records

**Key Features**:
- Each partition is ordered sequence
- Messages within partition get incremental ID (offset)
- Enables parallel processing
- Determines maximum parallelism

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Topic] -->|Contains| B[Partition 0]
    A -->|Contains| C[Partition 1]
    A -->|Contains| D[Partition N]
    
    B -->|Stores| E[Offset 0]
    B -->|Stores| F[Offset 1]
    B -->|Stores| G[Offset N]
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Partition Management**:
1. Leader/Follower Model
   - One broker is leader for partition
   - Others maintain replicas
   - Automatic leader election on failure

2. Replication Factor
   - Number of copies across cluster
   - Fault tolerance level
   - Trade-off between durability and resources

#### 3. Messages/Records
**Structure**:
```json
{
    "key": "user_123",
    "value": "actual_message_content",
    "timestamp": 1634567890,
    "headers": {
        "source": "web_app",
        "version": "1.0"
    }
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- Immutable once written
- Ordered within partition
- Contains metadata
- Optional key for partitioning

## 2. Producer Deep Dive

### Producer Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Producer Application] -->|1| B[Serializer]
    B -->|2| C[Partitioner]
    C -->|3| D[Record Accumulator]
    D -->|4| E[Sender Thread]
    E -->|5| F[Kafka Broker]
    
    style A fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Component Details

#### 1. Serializer
**Purpose**: Converts objects to byte arrays
**Types**:
- StringSerializer
- JsonSerializer
- AvroSerializer
- Custom Serializers

**Example Configuration**:
```java
properties.put("key.serializer", 
    "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
properties.put("value.serializer", 
    "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.JsonSerializer");
```

#### 2. Partitioner
**Functions**:
- Determines target partition
- Implements partitioning strategy
- Manages key-based routing

**Strategies**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Partitioning Strategies] -->|1| B[Round Robin]
    A -->|2| C[Key Hash]
    A -->|3| D[Custom Logic]
    A -->|4| E[Sticky Partitioning]
    
    style A fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Configuration Options**:
```java
properties.put("partitioner.class", 
    "org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.RoundRobinPartitioner");
```

#### 3. Record Accumulator
**Purpose**:
- Batches records for efficiency
- Manages memory buffers
- Implements batching logic

**Configuration Parameters**:
- batch.size: Maximum batch size in bytes
- linger.ms: Maximum wait time
- buffer.memory: Total memory for buffering

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Records] -->|Add| B[Memory Pool]
    B -->|Batch Full| C[Send]
    B -->|Linger Timeout| C
    
    style B fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Producer Guarantees
#reliability

#### 1. Acknowledgment Levels
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[acks=0] -->|No Wait| B[Fire and Forget]
    C[acks=1] -->|Leader ACK| D[Leader Confirmation]
    E[acks=all] -->|All Replicas| F[Full Durability]
    
    style A fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Details**:
- acks=0: Maximum throughput, no guarantees
- acks=1: Leader confirmation, possible data loss
- acks=all: Strongest durability, higher latency

#### 2. Retry Mechanism
**Configuration**:
```java
properties.put("retries", 3);
properties.put("retry.backoff.ms", 100);
```

**Retry Scenarios**:
- Network issues
- Leader elections
- Broker unavailability

### Producer Monitoring

    B -->|Track| F[error-rate]
    C -->|Track| G[byte-rate]
    D -->|Track| H[record-size-avg]
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

   - record-send-rate
   - record-error-rate
   - request-latency-avg

2. Topic Metrics
   - byte-rate
   - compression-rate
   - record-send-total

3. Record Metrics

   - record-queue-time-avg
   - records-per-request-avg

### Best Practices
#best-practices

1. Configuration Guidelines
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Producer Config] -->|Memory| B[buffer.memory]
    A -->|Batching| C[batch.size]
    A -->|Reliability| D[acks]
    A -->|Performance| E[compression.type]
    
    style A fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1. Error Handling
```java
producer.send(record, (metadata, exception) -> {
    if (exception != null) {
        // Handle error
        handleError(exception);
    } else {
        // Success tracking
        trackSuccess(metadata);
    }
});
```

1. Resource Management
- Proper producer closing
- Memory management
- Thread safety considerations
