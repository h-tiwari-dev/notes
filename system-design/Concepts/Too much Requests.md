# Handling High Request Volumes: Strategies for System Stability

## Introduction

In the world of web services and APIs, dealing with a high volume of requests is a common challenge. This document outlines several strategies to manage and mitigate issues arising from excessive concurrent requests.
### Generic Strategy
1. Gate-keeping to avoid malicious attacks
    - Cloud service providers and CDNs offer solution for these
2. Graceful degradation incase of over-loaded requests
    - Respond to requests based on priorities
3. Discarding requests altogether if needed
    - Useful incase any downstream or upstream service fails or is re-starting
    - Short-circuit: When the upstream services stop sending requests to the downstream services
    - Back-pressure: When the downstream services start failing requests from the upstream services

```
## Key Strategies

### 1. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of incoming requests from a client within a specified time frame.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{Rate Limit Check}
    B -->|Within Limit| C[Process Request]
    B -->|Exceeds Limit| D[Reject Request]
    D --> E[Return 429 Too Many Requests]
```

#### Implementation:
- Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms
- Set limits based on API key, IP address, or user account
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests)

### 2. Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Requests] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Server 1]
    B --> D[Server 2]
    B --> E[Server 3]
```

#### Types of Load Balancing:
- Round Robin
- Least Connections
- IP Hash
- Weighted Round Robin

### 3. Caching

Caching stores frequently requested data to reduce the load on backend services and databases.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Cache
    participant Server
    Client->>Cache: Request Data
    alt Data in Cache
        Cache->>Client: Return Cached Data
    else Data not in Cache
        Cache->>Server: Fetch Data
        Server->>Cache: Return Data
        Cache->>Client: Return Data
    end
```

#### Caching Strategies:
- In-memory caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Browser caching

### 4. Queueing

Queueing systems can help manage and process requests asynchronously, preventing system overload.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Incoming Requests] --> B[Queue]
    B --> C[Worker 1]
    B --> D[Worker 2]
    B --> E[Worker 3]
```

#### Benefits:
- Smooths out spikes in traffic
- Allows for better resource allocation
- Improves system reliability

### 5. Horizontal Scaling

Increase the number of server instances to handle higher loads.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Auto Scaler] --> B{Traffic Increase?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Spin Up New Instance]
    B -->|No| D[Maintain Current Instances]
    C --> E[Update Load Balancer]
```

#### Considerations:
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy scaling
- Implement auto-scaling based on metrics like CPU usage or request count

## Conclusion

Implementing a combination of these strategies can significantly improve your system's ability to handle high volumes of requests. The choice of techniques depends on your specific use case, infrastructure, and performance requirements.
