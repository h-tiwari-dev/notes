### 4. Large-Scale Database Migration

**Q: Describe your approach to migrating 500GB+ of financial data from MongoDB to MySQL with zero downtime. How would you optimize the schema and queries for improved performance?**

A: To perform this large-scale database migration with zero downtime, I would follow these steps:

30. **Pre-Migration Planning**:
   - Analyze the existing MongoDB schema and data patterns
   - Design an optimized MySQL schema considering the relational nature of the data
   - Create a detailed mapping between MongoDB documents and MySQL tables
   - Identify and plan for handling any data type mismatches or complex nested structures

31. **Setup and Infrastructure**:
   - Set up a staging environment that mirrors the production setup
   - Implement a dual-write system to keep both databases in sync during migration
   - Use tools like AWS Database Migration Service or custom ETL processes for data transfer

32. **Migration Process**:
   - Initial bulk transfer:
     - Use parallel processing to speed up the initial data transfer
     - Implement checkpointing to allow for resumable transfers in case of failures
   - Real-time synchronization:
     - Implement change data capture (CDC) on MongoDB to capture ongoing changes
     - Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to stream these changes to MySQL in real-time

33. **Data Validation and Integrity Checks**:
   - Develop comprehensive validation scripts to ensure data integrity
   - Perform regular checksums and record counts to verify consistency between systems
   - Implement automated reconciliation processes

34. **Application Changes**:
   - Modify the application to support reading from both MongoDB and MySQL
   - Implement a feature flag system to gradually shift read traffic to MySQL
   - Update write operations to use the dual-write system

35. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Schema optimization:
     - Normalize the data structure where appropriate
     - Use appropriate data types (e.g., use `DECIMAL` for financial amounts)
     - Implement indexing strategy based on common query patterns
   - Query optimization:
     - Analyze and optimize slow queries using EXPLAIN
     - Use covering indexes for frequently accessed data
     - Implement materialized views for complex aggregations
   - Caching strategy:
     - Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data
     - Use query result caching where appropriate

36. **Monitoring and Rollback Plan**:
   - Implement thorough monitoring for both databases during migration
   - Prepare a detailed rollback plan in case of critical issues
   - Set up alerts for any data inconsistencies or performance degradation

37. **Cutover Strategy**:
   - Gradually shift read traffic to MySQL using feature flags
   - Monitor performance and data consistency closely
   - Once confident, switch write operations to MySQL
   - Keep MongoDB as a read-only backup for a defined period

38. **Post-Migration**:
   - Perform a final validation of all data
   - Optimize MySQL configuration based on production workload
   - Update all application instances to use MySQL exclusively
   - Archive and decommission MongoDB after a safe period

39. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**:
    - Document the entire migration process, including any issues encountered and their solutions
    - Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new MySQL-based system
    - Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with the team

This approach ensures a smooth, zero-downtime migration while optimizing for performance in the new MySQL environment.

### **Redis vs Kafka for Managing API Request Queues**

Both **Redis** and **Kafka** are excellent choices for handling API request queues, but the best choice depends on your **use case, scale, durability, and ordering requirements**.

---

## **🔹 Redis for API Rate Limiting & Short-Lived Queues**

✅ **Best for:**

- **Low-latency, fast processing** (sub-ms retrieval).
- **Rate limiting** to prevent system overload.
- **FIFO (First In, First Out) queues** for lightweight task management.
- **Ephemeral requests** that do not need persistence.

🚫 **Not ideal for:**

- **Guaranteed delivery** (messages can be lost if a node fails).
- **Very high-volume, long-lived queues** (memory overhead).
- **Processing order consistency** across distributed workers.

🔹 **Example: Using Redis List for a Simple Queue**

```sh
LPUSH api_request_queue "request_1"
RPOP api_request_queue  # Process next request
```

- **LPUSH (Left Push)** adds a request.
- **RPOP (Right Pop)** processes it one by one.

🔹 **Rate Limiting Example (Prevent API Overload)**

```sh
INCR request_count:user123
EXPIRE request_count:user123 60  # Reset after 60 seconds
```

- Limits users to **X requests per minute**.

---

## **🔹 Kafka for High-Throughput, Persistent API Processing**

✅ **Best for:**

- **Durable, persistent queues** (messages are **not lost** if a node crashes).
- **Processing massive API requests (millions/sec)** across distributed workers.
- **Strict ordering & reprocessing** (consumer groups ensure ordering).
- **Event-driven systems** where multiple consumers process events independently.

🚫 **Not ideal for:**

- **Simple rate limiting** (better done in Redis).
- **Low-latency, in-memory processing** (Kafka is **slower than Redis** for real-time tasks).

🔹 **Example: Kafka-Based API Request Queue**

1. **Producer:** Sends API requests to a Kafka topic.
2. **Kafka Brokers:** Store messages durably.
3. **Consumer Workers:** Process requests **one by one** (or in parallel).

🔹 **Kafka Producer (Send API Requests)**

```python
producer.send("api_requests", key=b"user123", value=b'{"task": "process_payment"}')
```

🔹 **Kafka Consumer (Process Requests One by One)**

```python
for message in consumer:
    process_api_request(message.value)
    consumer.commit()  # Mark as processed
```

---

## **🔹 Key Differences: When to Use Redis vs Kafka?**

|**Feature**|**Redis** 🚀|**Kafka** ⚡|
|---|---|---|
|**Throughput**|High (sub-ms)|Very high (millions/sec)|
|**Persistence**|No (in-memory)|Yes (disk-based)|
|**Ordering**|FIFO (Single Node)|Ordered by partition|
|**Failure Handling**|No persistence, can lose data|Guarantees message delivery|
|**Use Case**|Rate limiting, fast ephemeral queues|High-scale, distributed event processing|
|**Latency**|Ultra-low latency|Slightly higher latency|

---

## **🔹 Final Recommendation**

- **Use Redis** if you need **fast, simple rate limiting or short-lived task queues**.
- **Use Kafka** if you need **durability, large-scale processing, and guaranteed delivery**.

🚀 **For API Rate Limiting + Processing**:

- Use **Redis for rate limiting** (`INCR/EXPIRE`).
- Use **Kafka for reliable queueing & processing**.

Would you like **code for integrating both Kafka & Redis in a hybrid queueing system**?
