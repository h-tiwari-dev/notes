## Overview
This document covers the core AWS services used in building a scalable notification system.

## Architecture Overview

    B -->|Filter & Route| C[SQS Queues]
    C -->|Trigger| D[Lambda Functions]
    D -->|Read/Write| E[DynamoDB]

    style C fill:#ddf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ffd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## SNS (Simple Notification Service) 
#messaging #pubsub

### Purpose
- Central pub/sub messaging backbone
- Notification distribution across channels

### Implementation Details
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Publishers] -->|Messages| B[SNS Topics]
    B -->|Filter| C[SMS Queue]
    B -->|Filter| D[Email Queue]
    B -->|Filter| E[WhatsApp Queue]
    
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Key Points
- Topic segregation by notification type
- Message filtering based on attributes
- Decoupled architecture

## SQS (Simple Queue Service)
#messaging #queue

### Purpose
- Message buffering
- Guaranteed delivery
- Handle high load scenarios

### Implementation Details
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[SQS Queue] -->|Poll| B[Lambda Worker]
    B -->|Process| C[Provider]
    B -->|Retry| A
    B -->|Failed| D[Dead Letter Queue]
    
    style A fill:#ddf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Configuration
- Visibility timeout settings
- Dead-letter queues (DLQ)
- Retry mechanism (3 attempts)

## SES (Simple Email Service)
#email #notification

### Purpose
- High-volume email delivery
- Reputation monitoring

### Implementation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Template Engine] -->|Render| B[Email Content]
    B -->|Send| C[SES]
    C -->|Track| D[CloudWatch]
    
    style C fill:#ffd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Features
- Dynamic templating
- Configuration sets
- Throttling rules
- Deliverability analytics

## Lambda Functions
#serverless #compute

### Purpose
- Orchestration logic
- Integration handling

### Implementation Details
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SQS Trigger] -->|Invoke| B[Lambda Function]
    B -->|Read| C[DynamoDB]
    B -->|Process| D[Business Logic]
    D -->|Send| E[Multiple Channels]
    
    style B fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Components
- Python-based functions
- Shared Lambda layers
- Auto-scaling capability
- Pay-per-use model

## DynamoDB
#database #nosql

### Purpose
- User preferences storage
- Configuration management
- Rate limiting

### Schema Design
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Table] -->|Partition Key| B[user_id]
    A -->|TTL| C[Expiration]
    A -->|Cache| D[DAX]
    
    style A fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## End-to-End Workflow
#workflow #architecture

```mermaid

    participant App
    participant SNS
    participant SQS
    participant Lambda
    participant DynamoDB
    participant SES
    
    App->>SNS: Publish notification
    SNS->>SQS: Route to queue
    SQS->>Lambda: Trigger processing
    Lambda->>DynamoDB: Fetch preferences
    Lambda->>SES: Send email
    SES-->>Lambda: Delivery status
```

## Key Advantages
#benefits

- Scalability: 0 â†’ 500K+ messages/day
- Reliability: Guaranteed delivery
- Cost-Efficiency: Pay-per-use
- Security: IAM roles & KMS encryption

## Interview Tips
#career #interview

- Focus on business outcomes
- Explain service selection rationale
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Highlight real-world scenarios

## Notes and Corrections
#notes

1. SNS Filtering: Based on message attributes only
2. SQS Timeout: Match Lambda processing time
3. SES Limitations: Sandbox mode considerations
4. DynamoDB TTL: Better for data expiration
5. Lambda Layers: Optional for small systems
