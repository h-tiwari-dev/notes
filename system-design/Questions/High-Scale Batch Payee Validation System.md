## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
#ingestion

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Batch Files] -->|Parse| B[Data Validator]
    B -->|Valid Records| C[Kafka Producer]
    B -->|Invalid Format| D[Error Handler]
    C -->|Publish| E[Kafka Topics]
    
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Key Features
- Batch file parsing
- Initial format validation
- Data partitioning
- Error logging

### 2. Message Queue System (Kafka)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Kafka Topics] -->|Partition 1| B[Consumer Group 1]

    A -->|Partition N| D[Consumer Group N]
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Configuration
- Multiple partitions for parallelism
- Consumer groups for load balancing
- Message retention policy
- Replication factor

### 3. Worker Pool Architecture
#processing

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Worker Pool Manager] -->|Spawn| B[Worker 1]
    A -->|Spawn| C[Worker 2]
    A -->|Spawn| D[Worker N]
    B -->|Process| E[Validation Logic]
    C -->|Process| E
    D -->|Process| E
    
    style A fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Features
- Dynamic scaling
- Health monitoring
- Resource optimization
- Load balancing

### 4. Redis Caching Layer
#cache #redis

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Workers] -->|Read/Write| B[Redis Cluster]
    B -->|Cache Hit| C[Fast Path]
    B -->|Cache Miss| D[Slow Path]
    
    style B fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Implementation
- Distributed caching
- TTL management
- Cache invalidation
- Cluster configuration

### 5. Error Handling & Retry Mechanism
#reliability #error-handling

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Worker
    participant Validator
    participant RetryQueue
    participant DeadLetterQueue
    
    Worker->>Validator: Validate Payee
    Validator-->>Worker: Validation Failed
    Worker->>RetryQueue: Queue for Retry
    RetryQueue->>Worker: Retry Processing
    Worker->>DeadLetterQueue: Max Retries Exceeded
```

## Performance Metrics
#performance

### Throughput
- 1M+ payees per day

    C -->|"<150ms"| D[Output]
```

## Error Recovery Strategy

### Automated Recovery Process
1. Immediate retry
2. Exponential backoff
3. Dead letter queue
4. Manual intervention triggers

### Monitoring & Alerts

    B -->|Threshold Breach| C[Alert Channels]
    C -->|Notify| D[Operations Team]
    
    style B fill:#fdd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## System Optimizations
#optimization

### 1. Batch Processing
