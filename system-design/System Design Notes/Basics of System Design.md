#### **1. Simplicity**

- **Keep it Minimal**: A simpler system is easier to maintain, debug, and extend. Avoid unnecessary complexity in architecture, dependencies, and interactions.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module/component should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion**: Ensure components are loosely coupled and highly cohesive to promote modularity.
- **YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It)**: Avoid adding features or abstractions unless they are necessary.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Strive for the simplest solution that meets the requirements.


#### **2. Fidelity**

- **Keeping All Requirements**: The system must fulfill all the specified requirements, ensuring that every requested feature, functionality, and constraint is honored.
- **Consistency & Accuracy**: The system should deliver accurate and consistent results across various conditions and failure scenarios.
- **Eventual vs. Strong Consistency**: Choose the right consistency model based on business needs. Some applications can tolerate eventual consistency (e.g., caching layers), while others require strong consistency (e.g., financial transactions).
- **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**: Design for failures by using retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, and distributed consensus mechanisms (Raft/Paxos).
- **Testing & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, performance testing) and active monitoring to maintain system fidelity.

#### **3. Cost Effectiveness**

- **Resource Utilization**: Optimize for efficient use of compute, memory, storage, and network resources.
- **Scalability vs. Over-Provisioning**: Design systems that scale horizontally/vertically without excessive upfront provisioning. Use auto-scaling where applicable.
- **Build vs. Buy Decision**: Evaluate whether to build a solution in-house or leverage third-party services (e.g., managed databases, cloud functions).
- **Operational Costs**: Consider long-term maintenance, observability, and DevOps overhead when designing a system.
